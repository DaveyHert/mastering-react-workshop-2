# Recursive Component Pattern

## Introduction

A simple definition of recursion in React context would be:

> **calling a function or component repeatedly within itself until a base condition (base case) is met**
> 

This is a very powerful pattern for dealing with data structures that possess nested children. Recursive components are unique in the sense that they can be called within themselves while they traverse through nested data until the *stopping or base condition* is reached.

## Mechanism

This pattern consists of a base condition that serves as a stop for the recursive loop, and a data structure containing different levels of nesting. 

Each recursive call is accompanied by the creation of a new stack frame to store the data of each call until the condition is met. This may not be a problem for small datasets, but for larger ones, it could lead to resource-intensive memory consumption.

## Use Cases

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Recursive pattern comes with quite a number of pitfalls and therefore, it should be applied sparingly.

A good reason to apply recursion would be when you have a reasonable amount of data that contain several levels of nesting: like a megamenu with several sub-links nested in some of the main links, a complex accordion, a nested navigation menu and so on.

## Benefits

The only major benefit of recursive approaches is the simplicity it provides, for either you as a developer writing or maintenance the code. Iterative approaches are usually faster but more cumbersome to write.

Here are the benefits worth considering:

- Less verbose code
- Easy maintainability

My rule of thumb üëç would be to use it only if other solutions would provide more unnecessary complexity.

## Cons

Recursive patterns could come with some concerns such as:

- a range error or stack overflow as a result of poorly written base condition
- intensive memory consumption due to the heaping of stack on each call
- potential reduced readability, since this is not a pattern most developers are used to on a day-to-day basis
- increased risk of fragile code especially if base condition is poorly written.
