# Mastering React: Building Predictable Apps Workshop

The goal of this project is to showcase the best practices in building very reliable React applications.

This workshop is not targeted at React beginners, but React developers with a good amount of experience in building with the library.

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Setup

The facilitator used yarn as the package manager. Feel free to use npm if that is your preference. See [EnvironmentSetup.md](/docs/EnvironmentSetup.md).

To set up project, **fork [sailsconf_react_workshop](https://github.com/EOEboh/sailsconf_react_workshop) into your own Github account.**

Then clone your repo locally.

```
- git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/sailsconf_react_workshop.git

- cd sailsconf_react_workshop

- yarn install
```

### Branches

We know that following along during live coding can be challenging. If you fall behind, don't worry. The facilitator has created branches for each transition in the workshop. They follow the naming convention `branch-STEP_NUMBER`.

To checkout a branch to get caught up, run the following command

```
git checkout BRANCH_NAME
```
